# SAGA A2UI

Safe Agentic Generative Applications — by [Machine Wisdom](https://machine-wisdom.ai).

TypeScript middleware for connecting existing services to assistant experiences, with renderer choice, explicit data-sharing rules, and server authorization hooks.

## Status

Repository setup is underway. A minimal private Lit application (`apps/lit-host`) builds and renders locally. No SDK packages or host compatibility are available yet, and the app has not been verified in ChatGPT or Claude. This repository starts private and is intended to become public after a separate publication decision.

The first implementation will exercise a small Lit application in ChatGPT and Claude. React and Lynx remain Stage A targets; Alexa+ enters the initial host investigation.

## Planned packages

| Package | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `@saga-a2ui/core` | Renderer-independent value objects and processing interfaces, with protocol-specific implementations in separate modules |
| `@saga-a2ui/mcp` | MCP app integration, data and action boundaries, and protocol error mapping |
| `@saga-a2ui/components` | Optional renderer-neutral component contracts and shared component behavior |
| `@saga-a2ui/lit` | Lit renderer integration |
| `@saga-a2ui/react` | React renderer integration |
| `@saga-a2ui/lynx` | Lynx renderer integration |

Developers retain their normal renderer tools and write the code that calls their APIs. A2A is a later integration; no placeholder package is published.

## Content safety

**Standard** permits validated HTTPS links through the host and images from explicitly allowed HTTPS hosts. **Strict** displays link and image references as inert text. Both preserve ordinary Markdown formatting and retain server authorization and data-sharing checks. Application code controls the policy.

The planned FaithfulCard component displays supplied Markdown without rewriting or silent truncation. Ansari-specific branding and presentation rules remain in Ansari.

## Development

This is an npm workspace skeleton; the root is private and is never published. Build and test commands for the local Lit application are under Local development below. See [contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) and [package layout](packages/README.md).

## License

The SDK uses [Apache-2.0](LICENSE). Preserve applicable third-party licenses and notices when adding dependencies or extracted code.

## Local development

Requires Node 22.12.0 or newer (pinned in `.nvmrc`; `nvm use`) and npm. No global tools are needed.

    npm ci                              # install from the committed lockfile
    npm start                           # Vite dev server at http://127.0.0.1:5173
    npm run build                       # build the Lit app into apps/lit-host/dist
    npm run typecheck                   # tsc --noEmit
    npx playwright install chromium    # one-time browser download for the check below
    npm run test:browser                # serves the built page and checks the visible title

`test:browser` expects `npm run build` to have run first; it loads the built page in Chromium and asserts that the heading "SAGA A2UI" is visible. CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs typecheck, build and the browser check on every pull request.

The only application is `apps/lit-host` (private, not published). It deliberately declares no `version`, so it introduces no owned version to enroll; add one only through the repository's version-policy bootstrap when that tooling exists. The workspace root stays private and no SDK packages exist yet.

### Fixture rendering (A2UI v0.9)

`apps/lit-host` renders a developer-authored A2UI v0.9 surface from synthetic public data. Tested, exactly pinned versions: `@a2ui/lit` 0.13.0, `@a2ui/web_core` 0.13.0 (both Apache-2.0), `zod` 3.25.76 (required by both), `lit` 3.3.3, Node 22.12.0+. The optional peer `@a2ui/markdown-it` is deliberately not installed.

- `src/catalog.ts`: application-owned catalog (`SagaPanel`: a title and a plain-text description bound to the data model).
- `src/fixture.ts`: initial messages (`createSurface`, `updateComponents`, `updateDataModel`).
- `src/main.ts`: `<saga-app>` feeds messages to one `MessageProcessor`; later `updateDataModel` messages change the visible text in place.
- Invalid messages, unknown catalogs/components or wrongly typed properties produce a visible "Could not render this content" alert. Values render only as Lit text bindings, so supplied markup stays inert text. No Markdown is applied to the description.

`e2e/fixture.spec.ts` drives the real processor through the page (`window.sagaSend`) and asserts rendered output. Recipe (same commands as above): `npm ci && npm run typecheck && npm run build && npx playwright install chromium && npm run test:browser`.
